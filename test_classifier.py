# PURPOSE: To demonstrate the proper usage of the classifier() function that 
#          is defined in classifier.py This function uses CNN model 
#          architecture that has been pretrained on the ImageNet data to 
#          classify images. The only model architectures that this function 
#          will accept are: 'resnet', 'alexnet', and 'vgg'. See the example
#          usage below.
#
# Usage: python test_classifier.py    -- will run program from commandline

# Imports classifier function for using pretrained CNN to classify images 
from classifier import classifier 

# Defines a dog test image from pet_images folder
test_image="pet_images/Collie_03797.jpg"

model = "vgg"

image_classification = classifier(test_image, model)

# prints result from running classifier() function
print("\nResults from test_classifier.py\nImage:", test_image, "using model:",
      model, "was classified as a:", image_classification)
